“@everyone if you update now, bc19run will save a replay even if you CRTL-C early, so you don't have to wait for games to finish.”

“one thing that's also worth considering is your castles spawn with resources very close by
i can describe how the mapgen does it
it runs a bfs out from the castle to 5*(fuel + karb depots)
and randomly puts them in that region -- if the castle is surround by lots of walls that region could be really long and skinny(edited)
so i guess if there's a ton of fuel+karb you could have some resources pretty far away
but empirically this is really rare
usually it's like 2-4 away max” - Sydriax
