Self-destruct crusaders at 10 health?

Moving diagonally is very fuel-efficient

Robot can hold karb and fuel simultaneously so going to adjacent or nearby mines is good.

oh god rushes are terrifying

We need some rush code so we can test defenses against it

Free messages by self-signaling and having robots check all robots to see if they are signaling
	Only 1 bit long, unless we take into account robot type
	What if we have robots listen for more than one round -> more bits communicated
	Or if we differentiate by type
		pilgrims -> "I am in danger!"
		crusaders -> "Nothing over here"
		castles -> "I am in danger!"

GiveAction costs 0 fuel, so pilgrim chains are indeed very good
